# Vibe Coding
It's all the rage and I wanted to try it. So here's some vibe coding for a clicker game where raccoons gather trash. It's not very good and I'm not a fan that it used TailwindCSS, but here it is. I used Gemini/Imagen 3 to generate the images. Vibe coding was done on Bolt. It kicked me out after a bit so I had to do the images myself. I spent too much time trying to get it to AI generate the images for me and it kept writing APIs that tried to call themselves.
